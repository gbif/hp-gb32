*Located in one of the most emblematic places in the city of Porto – the Botanical Garden, which together with it integrates the second pole of the Museum, the Hall of Biodiversity, officially opened to the public by His Excellency the President of the Portuguese Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on June 30, 2017, is the first Ciência Viva Center specifically devoted to biodiversity.*

### Excursion - Quinta do Seixo  

*The social program will include an excursion to Quinta do Seixo, located in the Alto Douro wine region, one of the world’s oldest wine regions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This region has a long-standing tradition of viticulture spanning millennia, and it is mainly known for producing port wine since the 18th century. The unique landscape of the Alto Douro wine region, with vineyards arranged in spectacular terraces bordering the river Douro and its principal tributaries, is one of the reasons for its selection as a World Heritage Site in 2001. Here, you will find Quinta do Seixo, located in the sub-region of Upper Corgo, benefiting from a prime location in the heart of the Douro Demarcated Region. Following the Douro River from Régua to Pinhão, one can easily discover this ancient property from the 17th century with more than 100 hectares, of which 70 hectares are planted with vineyards, and its winery of contemporary design. Quinta do Seixo is an emblematic estate home to some of the finest Sandeman Port Wines. This is the birthplace of high-quality grapes that produce superior wines like Sandeman Quinta do Seixo Vintage in very old vines, modern terraces, single rows, or biological vines. Quinta do Seixo’s heritage, with an over 100-year-old vineyard and a wide range of traditional grapes from the Douro, continues to resist the most aggressive conditions and temperatures and to produce unique and high-quality port wines, serving as a testament to Portugal’s amazing diversity in grapevine varieties. At Quinta do Seixo, you will find a unique blend of tradition and cutting-edge viticultural practices, encased in a perfect setting and a magnificent landscape, shaped by man in terraces made of schist.*
