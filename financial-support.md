The GBIF Secretariat offers the possibility of applying for partial financial support to attend 1) the **Global Nodes Training and Global Nodes Meeting** on 16-18 October 2025 and/or 2) the **Governing Board meeting** on 19-20 October 2025. Support may include partial funding of economy-class fight tickets and a subsidy to cover accommodation or a general lump sum.  

We encourage people to stay on for the [Living Data 2025 Conference](https://www.livingdata2025.com/) on 21-24 October, but this financial support does not cover the Living Data 2025 Conference. However, there will be some flexibility in travel dates for the air tickets covered by GBIF. See more information in the application form (link below). 

**The application process is now open.**  

Please see below for more details on the guidelines for seeking partial funding for the events. Link to the application form can be found at the bottom of this page.  

The deadline for applying is **30 April 2025**. Applications after the deadline will not be considered.  

The GBIF Secretariat will inform applicants about the outcome of their application shortly after the deadline.  

# Events covered 

## Global Nodes Training and Global Nodes Meeting, 16-18 October 2025

Partial financial support is only available to those who will attend both the Global Nodes Training and Global Nodes Meeting. 

Only one person per Participant, the node manager or designated alternate, is eligible to apply for partial support. 

As the funds available are limited, the requests for support will be prioritized as follows: 
- Node managers/alternates from Voting Participant countries which are in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions
- Node managers/alternates from other Voting Participants and Associate Country Participants
- Node managers/alternates from Other Associate Participants

## Governing Board meeting, 19-20 October 2025
Partial financial support for the Governing Board meeting is only available for GBIF Voting Participants from countries with per capita GDP below USD 13,500 which are in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions.  

These countries will be countries whose per capita GDP was less than USD13,500 according to the 2020 World Bank figures, the benchmark used to apply discountedcontributions in the current GBIF funding period (2023-2027). See list of GBIF country members here ADD LINK.  

Only one person per Voting Participant, the Head of Delegation, is eligible to apply for partialsupport. However, the Head of Delegation can reassign the support to a member of the delegation.  

## Attending both the Nodes events and the Governing Board meeting?
Individuals attending both the Global Nodes Training and Global Nodes Meeting and the Governing Board meeting may apply for support for one return flight and accommodation subsidy to cover the period of both events.

## How to apply
Fill in the GB32 application form for partial financial support and submit it no later than **30 April 2025. Applications received after the deadline will not be considered.**   

**Link to application form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoplI1y89JeEUAwCzaM2QjiR1G9_9HlnYDtPP9caCWY00E6A/viewform?usp=sharing)**  

Please note that funding will as a rule not be provided in advance of the meeting but by reimbursement after the meeting. Recognizing the lengthy time span between purchase of flight ticket and reimbursement of costs, the GBIF Secretariat offers the opportunity to reimburse flight costs straight after the tickets have been purchased, based on receipts, if needed. If applicants do not have the means to pre-finance the cost of a flight ticket, they may apply for GBIF to pay the air ticket costs directly. 

The accommodation subsidy will be 100 Euro per night. GBIF will cover arrival the night before the event starts and departure the day after the end of the event. The subsidy will be reimbursed to you after the event.

If selected for funding, the GBIF Secretariat will send you the reimbursement form for the air ticket costs (if not already covered directly by GBIF) and the accommodation subsidy. The reimbursement form must be submitted together with proof of costs by no later than two month after the meeting.

If you have any questions, please contact the GBIF Secretariat at [GB32@gbif.org](mailto:GB32@gbif.org).
